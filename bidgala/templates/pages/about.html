            William Lande & Sam Tenenbaum co-founded Bidgala out of Montreal, Canada when they noticed a pair of art students struggling to sell their work. The struggle for artists was intensified when the COVID-19 pandemic caused business closures and in-person event cancellations. William & Sam made it their mission to support all artists and to share their stories.
