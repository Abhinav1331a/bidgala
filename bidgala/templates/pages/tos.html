                        <h4>YOUR BIDGALA ACCOUNT</h4> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>You may need to have or log into your Bidgala account to use some of the Services.</li>
                            <li>You may need to connect a valid Payment Method to your Bidgala account to use some of the Services.</li>
                            <li>You may need to have an account with a relevant Payment Processor associated with or connected to your Bidgala account to use some of the Services. For example, sellers may need to connect Stripe to their account prior to selling on Bidgala.</li>
                            <li>You are responsible and liable for keeping your account information secure.</li>
                            <li>You may not use the Services, under any circumstance, if you are less than 18 years old or cannot form legally binding contracts.</li>
                            <li>We reserve the right to remove or edit content, conceal orders, close accounts, and refuse service at our sole discretion.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>SELLING FEES</h4> 
                        <p>If you sell anything on Bidgala, you are responsible and liable for paying Bidgala thirty percent (30%) of the total transaction amount.</p>    
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>FORMULA 1:</b> Total Transaction Amount = Art Price + Shipping Fee + any additions to the price</li>
                            <li><b>FORMULA 2: Bidgala</b> Transaction Fee = (Total Transaction Amount) x (30%)</li>
                            <li>Example: If you sell your art for $2000 and you charge $250 for shipping, then you must pay Bidgala 30% of $2250</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT OUR THIRTY PERCENT (30%) TRANSACTION FEE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FEE(S) THAT OTHER PARTIES OR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RELATED THIRD PARTIES, MAY CHARGE YOU.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For Illustrative Purposes: our Payment Processor (example; Stripe) may charge you 2.9% of the total transaction amount plus thirty cents ($0.30), as well as any additional fees mentioned in their terms of service, including but not limited to international fees (example: 0.6% of the total transaction amount) and/or foreign exchange fees. Our Payment Processor may also charge you additional fees for returns or disputes. For example, if a Buyer disputes a transaction, you may be liable for any fees and costs associated with the dispute resolution process to Bidgala, to the Payment Processor, to the Buyer’s bank, and to any other Related third parties. </li>
                            <li><b>ATTENTION:</b> Any fees mentioned in this Agreement that are not directly charged to you by Bidgala are subject to change, without notice to you. You are solely responsible and liable for understanding and proactively checking what the fees are for your use, whether direct or indirect, of Related Third Parties and/or their services. We may not update the fees of Related Third Parties in our Terms of Service. You are therefore responsible and liable for contacting the Related Third Parties or checking their terms of service yourself. </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>PAYMENTS AND BILLING</h4> 
                        <b>Processing Payments.</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We do not process any payments for any products posted, listed, shared, or uploaded to the Services - payment processing is managed by a Payment Processor (example: Stripe).</li>
                            <li>Any payments that are processed in connection with your use of the Services are subject to the obligations, terms, conditions, and policies of the applicable Payment Processor.</li>
                            <li>You agree to pay the full agreed-upon amount for any product that you purchase.</li>
                            <li>You hereby acknowledge and agree that the full amount charged for any product you purchase, in connection with your use of the Services, in the amount of an accepted order, offer or counter-offer may or may not include applicable taxes and/or shipping fees, which may vary between listings depending on factors including but not limited to the origin and destination of a shipment and the type of product purchased.</li>
                            <li>You are solely responsible and liable for informing yourself on, charging, collecting, and paying any and all relevant export/import fees, customs, applicable sales taxes, other taxes, similar government charges on orders shipped, or any other applicable fees in connection with your sales, shipments, and orders, including but not limited to any fees associated with international transactions. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Payment Method. You acknowledge and agree that the obligations, terms, conditions, or policies for any and all payments that you make in connection with your use of the Services shall be dependant on the applicable Payment Methods you authorize when using the Services (hereinafter referred to individually as the “Payment Method” and collectively as the “Payment Methods”), which may be affected or determined by any agreement(s) you have with the applicable Payment Processor, financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of the Payment Method you have chosen.</p>

                        <p>Vaulting payment information. In connection with your use of the Services, Bidgala and/or the applicable Payment Processor may store your payment information, connect said payment information to your profile, or save said payment information to help you to checkout faster or purchase more easily. You hereby acknowledge and agree that We or Our Payment Processor (example: Stripe) may store your payment information (example: credit card information) and charge your selected Payment Method at any time for any and all applicable fees or payments that you agree to or have agreed to while using the Services. You may remove, disconnect, or delete your payment information at any time by contacting us at info@thebidgala.com or (514)706-1818, or through your profile settings.</p>
                        
                            <p>Paid Services. Some of our Services may require you to pay an amount of money, a fee, or recurring fees (the “Paid Services”) now or in the future. For example, you may purchase artwork or sign up for a subscription service. You acknowledge and agree that the Paid Services are subject to and part of these Terms of Service.</p>

                        <p>Billing. If you are using the Paid Services, we use a Payment Processor to bill you via the Payment Method you linked to your Bidgala account and authorized for said Paid Services. Any payments processed in connection with your use of the Paid Services shall be subject to the obligations, terms, conditions, and policies of the applicable Payment Processor in addition to the obligations, terms, conditions, and policies outlined in this Agreement. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any errors, returns, or disputes in connection with your use of the applicable Payment Processor. By using the Paid Services, you agree to pay us the total agreed-upon amount for your use of said Paid Services through the applicable Payment Processor, and you authorize us to charge the Payment Method you chose, at any time, following your acceptance of said total agreed-upon amount. You hereby agree to pay the agreed-upon amount using said Payment Method that you selected. Bidgala reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that we make in connection with the amount we charge you for the Paid Services, even if we have already charged you the incorrect amount for said Paid Services. For example, whether you are a Buyer or a Seller, if you are mistakenly charged the wrong sales tax on a transaction that you are a party to, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you are responsible and liable for reconciling the difference(s) between the sales tax charged and the appropriate sales tax on any transaction that you make in connection with your use of the Services. </p>

                        <p>Payment And Billing Information Required. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO PROVIDE UP-TO-DATE, ACCURATE, AND COMPLETE BILLING INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD(S) YOU MAY STORE, CONNECT OR SAVE TO YOUR BIDGALA ACCOUNT. YOU SHALL COMPLETELY, PROACTIVELY, TRUTHFULLY, ACCURATELY, APPROPRIATELY, AND LEGALLY UPDATE ALL CONTACT INFORMATION, PAYMENT METHOD(S), ANY ANY OTHER INFORMATION NECESSARY TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD(S) COMPLETE, ACCURATE, VALID AND UP-TO-DATE (EXAMPLE: WHEN YOU UPDATE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, CHANGE YOUR LOGIN CREDENTIALS WITH AN APPLICABLE PAYMENT PROCESSOR, OR SHOULD YOUR PAYMENT METHOD(S) BE CANCELLED, EXPIRED, OR CHANGED). FURTHERMORE, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MUST CONTACT US AND ANY RELEVANT PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL BREACH OF SECURITY (EXAMPLE: IF ANOTHER PARTY HAS UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR BIDGALA OR PAYMENT PROCESSOR ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS). YOU MAY CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD OR PAYMENT INFORMATION IN YOUR SETTINGS. YOU MAY DISCONNECT YOUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR BY CONTACTING SAID PAYMENT PROCESSOR DIRECTLY. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT BIDGALA MAY CONTINUE TO CHARGE YOU FOR YOUR USE OF THE PAID SERVICES, UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE PAID <b>SERVICES</b>. </p>

                        <p>Changes In The Amount You Authorized. If you pre-authorized an amount to be charged to your account but the required amount to be charged changes (other than for reasons out of our control, including but not limited to a change in the amount of imposed sales tax), we shall provide you with the new amount and the date of said change within a reasonable amount of time before charging you said new amount. You further acknowledge and agree that Bidgala may accumulate charges that you incur in connection with your use of the Services and then charge them as one or multiple aggregate charges, at our sole discretion. </p>
                        
                        <p>Holds. To protect ourselves or other Users, we may, at our sole discretion, recommend to a relevant or applicable Payment Processor that they restrict your use of their services. Reasons for said recommendation may include, but are not limited to, your past or current activity while using the Services, your previous transactions, your previous returns, the total value of a transaction, or feedback from other Users. The Payment Processor may impose restrictions including but not limited to holds.</p>
                        
                        <h4>PURCHASING FEES</h4> 
                        <p>If you purchase anything whatsoever through the Services, you are responsible and liable for paying one hundred percent of the listing price charged at checkout, shipping fees charged at checkout, sales tax charged at checkout (amount may vary by region) or reconciled at a later date, and any other fees that may apply (including but not limited to customs fees you may be charged when the artwork is delivered or in transit, which may not be charged at checkout). Should your Payment Method fail, Bidgala may collect the amount you owe by charging a separate Payment Method on file, seeking legal counsel, requesting that the applicable Payment Processor deduct the amount you owe from your Stripe balance, or any other means available to Bidgala under Quebec law. You may also be liable for any fees that Bidgala incurs in our attempt(s) to collect the amount that you owe us, including but not limited to arbitration fees.
                        </p>

Sellers will ship the order within a maximum of fourteen (14) days after accepting your order and your selected Payment Method will be charged once the seller submits a tracking number. </p>
                        <p>If you purchase an item while using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible and liable for (i) determining and agreeing to (A) shipping methods for applicable product(s) and (B) Sellers’ and Buyers’ applicable payment obligations in connection therewith, including payment of any applicable sales or other taxes, and (ii) for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to any sale, purchase or shipment of products.</p>
                        <p>Sellers shall have the right to determine the shipping methods and costs for the sales of applicable products and to factor such costs into any decisions of such Seller regarding the acceptance or rejection of any Buyer’s offer, such Seller’s extension of any counteroffer, or whether to Accept Payment or Reject Payment in connection with an applicable Listing.</p>
